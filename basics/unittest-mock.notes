#  Into to unittest.mock
unittest.mock is a library for testing in Python. It allows you to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects and make assertions 
about how they have been used.

unittest.mock provides a core Mock class removing the need to create a host of stubs throughout your test suite. After performing an action, 

you can make assertions about which methods / attributes were used and arguments they were called with. You can also specify return values and 
set needed attributes in the normal way.

Additionally, mock provides a patch() decorator that handles patching module and class level attributes within the scope of a test, along with 
sentinel for creating unique objects. See the quick guide for some examples of how to use Mock, MagicMock and patch().

Mock is designed for use with unittest and is based on the ‘action -> assertion’ pattern instead of ‘record -> replay’ used by many mocking frameworks.

There is a backport of unittest.mock for earlier versions of Python, available as mock on PyPI.

# assertEqual()
assertEqual() in Python is a unittest library function that is used in unit testing to check the equality of two values. This function will take three 
parameters as input and return a boolean value depending upon the assert condition. If both input values are equal assertEqual() will return true else 
return false.
